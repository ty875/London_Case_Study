Great job getting through those challenging DataCamp courses. You're learning a lot in a short span of time. Let's see how this new knowledge can help solve a real world problem. \n","\n","In this notebook, we're going to apply the skills you've been learning, bridging the gap between the controlled environment of DataCamp and the *slightly* messier work that data scientists do with actual datasets!\n","\n","Here’s the mystery we’re going to solve: ***which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades?***\n","\n","\n","A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New York… well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London [(here's some info for the curious)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_boroughs). Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data will reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.\n","\n","This is the Tier Two notebook. Don't sweat it if you got stuck on the highest difficulty. You'll have a lot more guidance this time around. If you get stuck again, you can always drop down to Tier One.
